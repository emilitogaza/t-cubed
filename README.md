# T-Cubed: A Ultimate Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to T-Cubed, my own rendition of the classic Ultimate Tic Tac Toe, crafted with TypeScript and React JSX. The essence of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe remains, but with a modernized UI tha guides you along your play.

## Overview

If Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is new terrain for you, let's embark on a brief journey: Picture the beloved Tic Tac Toe, but exponentially amplified. The board unfolds as a matrix of several mini Tic Tac Toe grids. Conquering these mini grids is your ticket to victory on the main board. Here's the twist: where you place your mark within a mini grid determines where your adversary can play next on the main board. This layering infuses a strategic depth, making players have to think several moves ahead.

In T-Cubed, I've preserved the core mechanics of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe but enveloped them in a polished, UI. While the game currently supports local multiplayer face-offs, I'm working to create an online multiplayer mode.

## Features

- Strategic Depth: Navigate beyond the conventional 3x3 matrix. In T-Cubed, each play can dramatically reshape the game's trajectory.
- Sleek Design: Engage with a game interface that seamlessly blends the classic with the modern.
- Local Multiplayer: Indulge in intense local matchups, making every move count.
- Future-Proof: Gear up, as the online multiplayer realm is swiftly approaching.
